            <h3>Lou Malnati's</h3>
            <p>Malnati’s success comes from their commitment to quality. Every Lou Malnati’s pizza is handmade from scratch using the finest and freshest ingredients. Every year, the Malnati team hand selects California vine-ripened tomatoes for the perfect sweet and tangy taste. The exclusive sausage blend is seasoned to our exact specifications. The fresh mozzarella cheese comes from the same small dairy that has supplied Lou Malnati’s for over 40 years. And our family’s secret recipe for flaky, buttery crust has been passed down from generation to generation. You’ll know with every bite that each pizza was made with care and special attention.</p>

            <p>Pizano's opened in 1991 and the legacy is the foundation. Words from owner: I learned about pizza from my father with that knowledge developed our now famous thin crust pizza that Oprah has called "her favorite" and the USA Today listed as top 10 in the Nation. We feature great food steeped in Italian tradition, skillfully prepared from the highest quality ingredients, and served in an inviting atmosphere in which to celebrate friendship and family.</p>

            <h3>Pequod's</h3>
            <p>THE YEAR WAS 1970. HIDDEN AWAY ON FERNALD AVENUE IN MORTON GROVE ILLINOIS, PEQUODS PIZZA STARTED A CULT FOLLOWING FOR ITS PAN STYLE PIZZA WITH A “CARAMELIZED CRUST” EDGE.
                Locals enjoyed the hometown pizzeria for its unique atmosphere and great deep dish pizza. In June of 1986 the original owner sold the pizzeria, leading to a rebirth. New leadership reinvigorated the restaurant. The menu expanded and a savory thin crust pizza was added to the fabled pan pizza. As word of mouth popularity grew, Pequod’s became the best known secret for Pizza in Chicago’s northwest suburbs. Many of the faithful continue to make pilgrimages to Pequods after moving from the Chicago area. January 1992 began a new chapter in the Pequod’s legend. In response to the pleading of many faithful customers, Pequods opened in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. Thanks to the enthusiastic patronage of loyal customers, Pequod’s began to build a new cult following in the Windy City, quickly becoming known for late night pizza and delivery of their world class deep dish pizza.</p>
